This repository is for the manuscript "Do We Need Full Updates: Integer Programming for Sparse Personalized Federated Learning".

Our code was implemented on the basis of this repository: https://github.com/FLAIR-Community/Fling. We hereby express our gratitude to its owner and the original author of the paper entitled "Bold but Cautious: Unlocking the Potential of Personalized Federated Learning through Cautiously Aggressive Collaboration".

The main code part of our method locates in fling/components/client/ and fling/components/group/ with the name "purin" included.
